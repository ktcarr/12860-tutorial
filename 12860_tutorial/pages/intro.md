# Introduction 
The purpose of this tutorial is to provide practical guidance on how to analyze gridded climate data stored on WHOI's servers using python. The tutorial is designed to take place over ~6 hour-long sessions, and is designed to cover four topics: (1) data pre-processing, (2) model validation, (3) using pre-industrial control runs to detect a climate change signal, and (4) model intercomparison.
