# 11/7 tutorial

The goal of this tutorial is to:
1. Recap. internal variability vs. external forcing  
2. Introduce significance testing for climate change detection
3. Introduce single-forcing experiments and paleo-proxies

We'll use a synthetic climate model for Parts (1) and (2), and reproduce results from a Nature Geoscience paper for Part (3).
