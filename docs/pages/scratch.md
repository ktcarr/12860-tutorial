## What is climate variability?
- Climate *variability*: "slow" changes in some property of ocean/atmosphere, which may appear to "oscillate"
- What is slow? Good question! One definition: longer than "weather" timescales (~2 weeks)
- Often think climate variability as a set of distinct "modes" (e.g., El Niño / La Niña, Madden-Julian Oscillation)
- These modes have different feedbacks/mechanisms which lead to different spatial patterns and timescales
- Almost like "emergent" properties - e.g., depend on continental configuration

## Observations, models, and reanalysis
- What's the difference? What do we use these tools for?

### Observations
- Gold standard: everything is based on these! E.g., use them to guide model development.
- Challenge: they're sparse!

### Models 
- (Mostly) physically-consistent evolution of climate system (solving differential equations).
- Easier to compute robust statistics (just run the model a bunch of times!) and study "modes" with long timescales
- Makes it possible to estimate future changes to climate (e.g., effect of greenhouse gas emissions)
- Challenge: for computational reasons, have to make approximations; these approximations lead to biases/errors.

### Reanalysis
- Uses a model to "fill the gaps" in observations
- Idea: atmosphere is chaotic, and simulations with slightly different initial conditions will diverge quickly (weather timescales).
- Therefore, we use the observations to "pull" the model back every few hours, so that it doesn't diverge.
- Have to make compromises: won't exactly match observations and won't conserve properties that should be conserved (unlike models)

## To-dos
- EOFs section: talk about North et al. (1982), "Sampling errors in the estimation of..."
- Also see wiki page on [integral equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_equation), including specific section on integral equations as a generalization of eigenvalue equations.
- Also: post some resources about EOFs (e.g., the ones from Caroline)
