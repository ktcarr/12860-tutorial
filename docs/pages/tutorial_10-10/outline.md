# Outline

## What are climate modes, anyway?
- "Climate modes represent natural, recurrent patterns of variability in the climate system. Their periodic
nature can aid in seasonal forecasting, or longer-term predictions from interannual to decadal timescales."
- But why? Think about modes of guitar strings – depend on boundary conditions / mean state.

## Example: ENSO

### Physics of ENSO
- recharge oscillator

### Observed ENSO characteristics
- spatial pattern of composites
- $T$, $h$ cross-correlation

### Questions
- changes in mean state?
- changes in spatial pattern of composites (e.g., warm vs. cold)
- changes in autocorrelation/predictability? (e.g., see McPhaden/Meinen paper)
- change in frequency of CP vs. EP Niño events?
- change in frequency of multi-year events?
- *(optional)* changes in spatial structure/teleconnections?

### Data analysis to-do
1. *(optional)* Dask set-up?
2. Load in tropical Pacific data
3. Compute observed characteristics (spatial comps, autocorrelation, multi-year frequency)
4. Compute future characteristics
5. Implications?

#### Timeline
**1200-1300**: load in data, setup Dask  
**1340-1600**: compute observed stats
**1600-1630**: draft slides (incl. on climate modes!)
**1630-1730**: finetune slides
