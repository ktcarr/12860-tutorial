# Background
**Updates coming soon â€“ check back after class on 9/20**

## What is climate variability?
- First, what is climate? One definition: long-term statistics of the ocean/atmosphere/ice/land/etc
## CMIP6 server
- Use GUI to browser output
- Using ```ncdump```

## Other places to find data
- Accessing ERA5 Google/ARCO from the cloud (this is the future !?)
- IMERG/TRMM?

## Plan
- **Today (in class)**: compute regional climate statistics in a *reanalysis* product
- **Assignment 1**: evaluate the same statistics in a climate *model*
- Next time: "modes" of climate variability!
